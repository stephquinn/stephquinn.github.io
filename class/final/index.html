            <p>Not counting the City of Baltimore, the western Maryland cities of Cumberland and Frostburg were the
                sites of the most sewer overflows reported to the Maryland Department of the Environment's Water and
                Science Administration since 2012.</p>
            <p>Overflows have decreased overall across the state in this period, but spiked in years of high
                precipitation.
            </p>
            <p>Baltimore City had more overflows than any county except Allegany. While Allegany County had 5,652 in the
                past decade, Baltimore had 5,487, according to Water and Science Administration data. The county with
                the next most reported overflows after Baltimore City - Baltimore County - had less than a fifth that
                number. </p>

            <p>The cause of these overflows? Rain and history, according to experts and state reporting.</p>
