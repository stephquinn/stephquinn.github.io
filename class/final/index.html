            <h3>By Steph Quinn</h3>
            <p>Not counting the City of Baltimore, the western Maryland cities of Cumberland and Frostburg were the
                sites of the most sewer overflows reported to the Maryland Department of the Environment's Water and
                Science Administration since 2012.</p>
            <p>With the cities of Cumberland and Baltimore operating under consent decrees from the state and the U.S.
                Environmental Protection Agency, overflows have decreased overall in Allegeny County and Baltimore City
                during the past decade. But overflows spiked in years of high
                precipitation.
            </p>
            <p>Baltimore City had more overflows than any county except Allegany. While Allegany County had 5,652 in the
                past decade, Baltimore had 5,487, according to Water and Science Administration data. The county with
                the next most reported overflows after Baltimore City - Baltimore County - had less than a fifth that
                number. </p>

            <p>Cumberland and Frostburg’s 2,661 and 1,589 overflows since 2012 shrink in comparison to Baltimore’s
                5,487. But they’re out of proportion with the relatively small populations of these Allegany County
                cities.</p>
            <p>Cumberland has spent $59 million on improvements in keeping with the city's 2001 consent decree. A March
                2022 report by the City of Baltimore projected that improvements to the city's sewer infrastructure in
                keeping with its consent decree would total $241.3 million by 2030.</p>
            <p>The cause of these overflows? Rain and history, according to experts and state reporting.</p>
            <p>Brad Metzger, the district manager of the Maryland Water and Science Administration’s western field
                office, said Cumberland’s frequent overflows happen because the city and its sewer system are old.</p>
            <p>A modern map of Maryland highways shows a north-south artery between the state’s two major urban metro
                areas, Baltimore and Washington.</p>
            <p>But throughout the 1800s, U.S. Route 40, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal
                formed a thoroughfare threading westward across the state, Metzger said.</p>

            <p>Cumberland has a combined sewer system. Old sewer systems tend to be combined sewers, Metzger said, where stormwater and sanitary sewage go into the same pipe.</p>
            <p>“They weren’t contemporaneous with modern expectations,” Metzger said.</p>
            <p>Combined sewers are designed to funnel the flow to be treated before releasing it into local waterways. But during rainy spells, stormwater runoff overwhelms the system, flowing with sewage into watersheds before it can be treated.</p>
            <p>In Baltimore City, the number of reported overflows has decreased overall and more closely follows precipitation levels since 2012. For instance, 2012 - with 37.4 inches of rain, not an unusual rainfall year for the city - saw the highest number of overflows: 671. 2018, when it rained more than 70 inches of rain, had fewer overflows, and 2022, when precipitation was similar to 2013 levels, had the least number of overflows: 324.</p>

            <p>In Allegany County, too, a wet 2018, with 68 inches of rain, saw 813 overflows, compared to 278 in 2021, the driest year.</p>
