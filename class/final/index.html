                        sites of the most sewer overflows reported to the Maryland Department of the Environment's Water

                        precipitation, and the potential impacts of climate change on sewer systems' ability to
                        withstand strong storms are unclear.

                    <p>Cumberland has spent $59 million on improvements in keeping with the city's 2001 consent decree.
                        A
                        March
                        2022 report by the City of Baltimore projected that improvements to the city's sewer
                        infrastructure
                        to meet the requirements of its 2002 consent decree would total $241.3 million by 2030.</p>
                    <p>The cause of these overflows? Rain and history, according to experts and state reporting.</p>
                    <p>Brad Metzger, the district manager of the Maryland Water and Science Administration’s western
                        field
                        office, said Cumberland’s frequent overflows happen because the city and its sewer system are
                        old.
                    </p>
                    <p>A modern map of Maryland highways shows a north-south artery between the state’s two major urban
                        metro
                        areas, Baltimore and Washington.</p>
                    <p>But throughout the 1800s, U.S. Route 40, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake & Ohio
                        Canal
                        formed a thoroughfare threading westward across the state, Metzger said.</p>

                    <p>Cumberland has a combined sewer system. About 700 U.S. cities have combined sewers, where
                        stormwater and sanitary sewage go into the same pipe, according to a January 2023 report by the
                        Government
                        Accountability Office.</p>
                    <p>“They weren’t contemporaneous with modern expectations,” Metzger said.</p>
                    <p>Combined sewers are designed to funnel stormwater and sanitary sewage to be treated before
                        releasing it
                        into local waterways.
                        But during rainy spells, stormwater runoff overwhelms the system, flowing along with sewage into
                        watersheds
                        before it can be treated.</p>
                    <p>Baltimore separated its combined sewers and designed or completed 23 capital projects so far to
                        meet
                        state and federal requirements, according to the city's January 2023 plan for phase two of the
                        consent
                        decree.</p>
                    <p>Since 2012, Baltimore's number of reported overflows has decreased overall and appears to more
                        closely
                        follow
                        precipitation levels. For instance, 2012 - with 37.4 inches of rain, not an unusual rainfall
                        year for the city - saw the highest number of overflows: 671. 2018, when it rained more than 70
                        inches
                        of rain, had fewer overflows, and 2022, when precipitation was similar to 2013 levels, had the
                        least
                        number of overflows: 324.</p>

                        Rainfall and precipitation were by far the most commonly cited causes of overflows in Baltimore
                        City and
                        Allegany County.</p>
                    <p>Precipitation patterns may be set to change. According to the U.S. Global Change Research
                        Program, a
                        federal program researching environmental change,
                        extreme precipitation events across a swath of the northeastern U.S. including Maryland
                        increased by 38%
                        between 1901 and 2016, second only to 42% in the Midwest.
                    </p>
                    <p>The benchmarks for Baltimore's compliance with the requirements of its consent decree are
                        informed by
                        historical precipitation data, according to the January 2023 city plan.
                    </p>
                    <p>And Cumberland officials expressed their uncertainty how climate change may interfere with their
                        plans,
                        according to the GAO report.

                    <p>
                        State data from the past decade suggests a complicated picture for sewer overflows. Though the
                        wettest years have seen the most overflows in places most affected by sewer woes, overflows have
                        decreased overall alongside state and city infrastructure improvements.
