                        From the intentionality of each lyric and note, to the precision with which she applies her red
                        lipstick, Taylor Swift leaves no details to chance.

                    <p>
                        Ms. Swift made an indelible mark on the global stage as a singer-songwriter with extraordinary
                        talent and has built a business on her
                        own terms. While her art is one of communication — through words and notes and human emotions —
                        Taylor Swift should also be recognized as a masterful communicator in the digital age while
                        off-stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At its core, the field of communications is one of persuasion — whether one is selling an idea,
                        a
                        product or a service — and Taylor Swift does this like few others. Using the launch of her 10th
                        original studio album Midnights as an exemplar, a playbook emerges with best practices for a
                        successful launch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though some paid promotions were activated in the countdown to the release of Midnights, Taylor
                        Swift relied heavily on earned, shared and owned channels for her well-planned communications
                        strategy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given her status as a multiple Grammy Award–winner and global icon, without a well-planned
                        launch campaign....

                        While most brands don’t have an audience of the magnitude and level of devotion that Taylor
                        Swift
                        has, the example of her album Midnights does offer a roadmap for introducing new products into
                        the market.

                    <p>
                        This got us thinking…and so we turned to social listening tools, tracked mentions and sentiment
                        against Taylor Swift’s multi-channel messaging.

                        One thing became clear: Even when you are as beloved a superstar as Taylor Swift, a strategic
                        and
                        well-balanced communications campaign should still be part of every product launch.

                        Behind every successful launch is a strategic plan. As she <a

                        things her fans tease her about is the meticulous “needing to plan things out.” She continued,
