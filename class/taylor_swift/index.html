                        From the intentionality of each lyric and note, to the precision with which she applies her red
                        lipstick, Taylor Swift leaves no details to chance.

                    <p>
                        Ms. Swift made an indelible mark on the global stage as a singer-songwriter with extraordinary
                        talent and has built a business on her
                        own terms. While her art is one of communication — through words and notes and human emotions —
                        Taylor Swift should also be recognized as a masterful communicator in the digital age while
                        off-stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At its core, the field of communications is one of persuasion — whether one is selling an idea,
                        a
                        product or a service — and Taylor Swift does this like few others. Using the launch of her 10th
                        original studio album Midnights as an exemplar, a playbook emerges with best practices for a
                        successful launch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though some paid promotions were activated in the countdown to the release of Midnights, Taylor
                        Swift relied heavily on earned, shared and owned channels for her well-planned communications
                        strategy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given her status as a multiple Grammy Award–winner and global icon, without a well-planned
                        launch campaign....

                        While most brands don’t have an audience of the magnitude and level of devotion that Taylor
                        Swift
                        has, the example of her album Midnights does offer a roadmap for introducing new products into
                        the market.

                    <p>
                        This got us thinking…and so we turned to social listening tools, tracked mentions and sentiment
                        against Taylor Swift’s multi-channel messaging.

                        One thing became clear: Even when you are as beloved a superstar as Taylor Swift, a strategic
                        and
                        well-balanced communications campaign should still be part of every product launch.

                        Behind every successful launch is a strategic plan. As she <a

                        things her fans tease her about is the meticulous “needing to plan things out.” She continued,

                    <p>
                        In the period following MTV’s 2022 Video Music Awards, when Taylor Swift first spoke of the
                        Midnights launch date, she garnered 9,153,654 mentions, a 170% increase over the previous 58
                        days (which saw just 3,387,464 mentions).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And in the week for the on-sale date, the increase was even more dramatic: the number of
                        mentions
                        in social was up 216% over the previous 7 days with 3,263,797 mentions (making up 36% of that 9M
                        volume).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Looking at sentiment, the announcement and the album release pushed positive conversation up and
                        the negative sentiment down; the number of positive mentions alone increased by 192%. Again,
                        this becomes even more dramatic when looking at the week before the album release, when we see
                        volumes of positive discussion increase 394% over the previous week.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both shifts can, in part, be explained by a pivot in conversation after Swift saw criticism over
                        a late July report naming the singer as the biggest CO2 emitter of any celebrity. Following the
                        VMA announcement, however, peaks in conversation were all attributable to anticipation for
                        Midnights, fueled by the artist’s track name release (with particular excitement around the Lana
                        Del Rey collaboration), and discussion around the American Music Awards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though October 21, the day of the release, saw a slightly smaller peak than the initial
                        announcement, it has resulted in more sustained levels of conversation, netting more than 2.2M
                        mentions in three days, compared to the VMA announcement which netted 1.3M in three days.

                        huge and wildly active on social channels—and authoritative media outlets with international
                        reach and bloggers alike are game to cover the musical icon from whichever angle best suits

                        The song “Anti-Hero” is by far the most talked-about song on social. This may be attributable to
                        a number of factors, including the power and appeal of the song in and of itself, airplay,
                        ranking on streaming services, airplay, and the #TSAntiHeroChallenge launched by Taylor Swift on
                        YouTube Shorts on October 21.

                        The “3am Edition” tracks were generally less buzzed about than those on the original album, with
                        the same holding true for the song “Hits Different” that was released as an exclusive to the CDs

                        Social listening provided another layer of intelligence on consumer reception. Beginning a month
                        prior to Midnights’ release, fans reacted enthusiastically to a series of Taylor Swift TikToks
                        announcing track titles, #MidnightsMayhemWithMe. In comments, fans speculated on hidden meanings
                        and easter eggs as merch, multiple versions of the album and concert dates were announced.

                        Most fans were elated at the 3:00 a.m. announcement on October 21 of additional tracks, however
                        some reacted less favorably, concerned that the album they had pre-ordered would not include the
                        bonus tracks, meaning they might need to make additional purchases.
                    </p>

                        On an October 24 Instagram post showing a Times Square ad of Pandora streaming Midnights,
                        #TaylorNation expressed strong preferences for Spotify or Apple Music as their listening
                        platform.

                        After tour dates were officially announced, fans who endured long waits to book tickets and were
                        unable to complete their purchases expressed frustration at the Ticketmaster fail or in some
                        cases, prohibitively expensive ticket prices.

                        clustered in October around the release of Midnights with @AppleMusic surveying fans about their
                        favorite album to date and congratulating Taylor on the album release. Engagement for a post
                        about Lana Del Rey’s collaboration on the album also contributed to the positivity of social
                        chatter.

                        Much of the measurable public-facing commentary around Midnights is driven by Swift’s strategic
                        use of social media on platforms where fans, Taylor Nation (an arm of her PR team), and other
                        interested accounts can amplify official announcements and share their own points of view and
                        interpretations of what’s been revealed and what’s coming.

                    <p>
                        Looking closely at the teaser content Swift chose to publish in the lead-up to Midnights, each
                        tasty morsel of information is revealed one at a time: the album cover, release date and
                        pre-order link; collectible vinyl editions, a “making of” video; the track list; announcement of
                        publicity appearances and so on. Using text, photographs, and short videos, the world is
                        introduced to the new album and Taylor Swift is kept top of mind in this 7-week period. There is
                        new news each week.
