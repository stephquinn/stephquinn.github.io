                    From the intentionality of each lyric and note, to the precision with which she applies her red
                    lipstick, Taylor Swift leaves no details to chance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ms. Swift made an indelible mark on the global stage as a singer-songwriter with extraordinary
                    talent and has built a business on her
                    own terms. While her art is one of communication — through words and notes and human emotions —
                    Taylor Swift should also be recognized as a masterful communicator in the digital age while
                    off-stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At its core, the field of communications is one of persuasion — whether one is selling an idea, a
                    product or a service — and Taylor Swift does this like few others. Using the launch of her 10th
                    original studio album Midnights as an exemplar, a playbook emerges with best practices for a
                    successful launch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though some paid promotions were activated in the countdown to the release of Midnights, Taylor
                    Swift relied heavily on earned, shared and owned channels for her well-planned communications
                    strategy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given her status as a multiple Grammy Award–winner and global icon, without a well-planned
                    launch campaign....

                    While most brands don’t have an audience of the magnitude and level of devotion that Taylor Swift
                    has, the example of her album Midnights does offer a roadmap for introducing new products into
                    the market.

                <p>
                    This got us thinking…and so we turned to social listening tools, tracked mentions and sentiment
                    against Taylor Swift’s multi-channel messaging.
