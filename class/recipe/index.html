    <p>I love the combination of flavors in this unusual soup. The red lentils  partially dissolve while cooking, creating a creamy texture and the coconut milk creates an intriguing, almost nutty note. Serve as a starter or add an Indian bread and salad for a delicious light meal.</p>
    <p><b>Serves:</b> 8 to 10 as a starter or 4 to 6 as a main course</p>
    <p><b>Total time:</b> half-day</p>
    <p><b>Equipment:</b> crock pot</p>
    <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>If you don't have fresh chili peppers, stir in your favorite hot pepper sauce, to taste, just before serving.</li>
        <li>For an enhanced cumin flavor, toast the cumin seeds and coarsely crush  before using in this recipe.</li>
        <li>Make ahead: This soup can be partially prepared the night before it is cooked. Complete Steps 1 and 2. Cover and refrigerate overnight. The next day, continue cooking as directed in Step 3.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (500 ml) red lentils</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (15 ml) vegetable oil</li> 
        <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, peeled, cut in half lengthwise and thinly sliced</li> 
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tsp (10 ml) turmeric</li> 
        <li>2 tsp (10 ml) cumin seeds (see Notes)</li> 
        <li>1 tsp (5 ml) salt</li> 
        <li>Â½ tsp (2 ml) cracked black peppercorns</li> 
        <li>1 can (28 oz/796 ml) tomatoes, including juice</li> 
        <li>6 cups (1.5 L) vegetable stock</li> 
        <li>1 can (14 oz/398 ml) coconut milk</li> 
        <li>1 tbsp (15 ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice</li> 
        <li>1 long red chili pepper or 2 Thai chilies, finely chopped (see Notes)</li> 
        <li>Thin slices lemon (optional)</li>
        <li>Finely chopped cilantro (optional)</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a colander, rinse lentils thoroughly under cold running water. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions and carrots and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, turmeric, cumin seeds, salt and peppercorns and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add tomatoes with juice and bring to a boil, breaking up with the back of a spoon. Stir in reserved lentils and stock.</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture to slow cooker stoneware. Cover and cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours or on High for 4 to 5 hours, until carrots are tender and mixture is bubbling. Stir in coconut milk, lemon juice and chili pepper and cook on High for 20 to 30 minutes, until heated through.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and top with lemon slices and cilantro, if using.</li>
